# Decision-Trees-and-Support-Vector-Machines
--I have used the version of Python 3.9.7 <br /> 
--I have used Microsoft Windows for operating system <br /> 
--There are 3 different python files, 1 of them is using to test the code for the decision trees and the other two are for the codes of the algorithms. <br /> 
--First, the numpy package needs to be imported, if you don't have it on your computer, you need to install it. <br /> 
--For second part I used sklearn.svm and also all the 4 part in the same file which is svm.py. <br /> 
--Also, there is a menu in the second part(svm part), and we can control which task we want to run from the menu. <br /> 
--There are also datasets in the hw3 file. <br /> 
--To load the datasets we need the path of the datasets. <br /> 
For example, on my own computer, the path is as follows; C:/Users/ASUS/Desktop/Cng409/hw3/dt/train_set.npy <br /> 
To run the code on your own computer, you need to replace these paths with paths with your own datasets. <br />
